Melody comes from the Greek word melōidía. A melody in music is a group of notes of various
pitches (how high or low a note sounds) which are played one after another. Together they make a
tune in the same way that a group of words make a sentence. Songwriters and composers
use melodies in their music to tell stories and give audiences something to remember and connect
with. The most obvious way to use melodies in music is through verse, chorus, and bridge vocal
lines, but instrumental melodies are also important. what we first hear in a song is its melody rather
than words. 
Automated melody generation has been a widely researched method of producing new music for
many years now. The previous methods produced simplified music pieces with noncomplex
melodies and many inadequacies like predictable repeating melodies. In addition to traditional tasks
such as prediction, classification and translation, deep learning is attracting growing attention as an
approach for melody generation, as we can witness recent research groups such as Magenta at
Google and CTRL (Creator Technology Research Lab) at Spotify. The motivation is in using the
capacity of deep learning architectures and training techniques to automatically learn musical styles
and generate samples from the learnt distribution. The question that can machines be more creative
than humans has always been answered disputedly.

It is very difficult to make a unique and memorable melody. The problem statement is to help
composers create unique and harmonious melody with the help of advanced deep learning and
machine learning methods.
